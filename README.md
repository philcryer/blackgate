#blackGATE :: privacy and anonymity for everyone
=========
##transform any x86 based machine into a secure gateway appliance

_blackGATE is a minimal Debian GNU/Linux environment that runs from a LiveCD or a USB drive on any standard x86 system turning it into a privacy and anonymity gateway to the Internet. Just burn the ISO file to CD or a USB drive, boot from it, it will automatically load the server environment into memory and provide a privacy, security, filtering gateway appliance for everyone on your network to point at and use. Since it runs from read-only media and is only resident in memory there is no logging or any type of persistence. Naturally, blackGATE is open source software._

##how's your privacy online? here's how blackGATE can improve it

* effortlessly surf through blackGATE to the Tor anonymity network (more networks soon)
* use with web browsers, instant messaging clients, remote logins, and more
* blackGATE simply runs as the gateway, there are no clients to install
* runs on any x86 based hardware - standard Intel/AMD hardware

##todo, proposed future functionality

* protocols, basic tools to allow for more private, secure internet connection
* Project Meshnet (CJDNS) http://projectmeshnet.org/
* I2P http://www.i2p2.de/
* Privoxy http://www.privoxy.org/
* DNSCrypt https://github.com/opendns/dnscrypt-proxy
* web ui to show status, turn options on off, give connection directions
* Openpanel http://www.openpanel.com/
* Opennap is built on Openpanel, has some networking functionality http://www.openpanel.com/openapp/openapp-nap/
* web filter to control where users can surf (Squid-guardian)
* virus blocker detects threats from the web (ClamAV)
* Spyware Blocker stops Websites and files from infecting users (ClamAV)
* ad blocker removes detected ADs while users are surfing (Privoxy)
* investigate running blackGATE within the OpenWRT enviornment as an ebedded system on routers
